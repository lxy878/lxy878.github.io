Finally, I completed the sinatra project!!!  I feel that the project is less difficult but more complex than the CLI project.  The project requirements don't focus on write ruby classes like the CLI, They more focus on building a web application.  I need to implement different gems to link pieces of database, models, and views.  

My idea is to build a course registration system for departments of majors.  The program requires the individual department to have an account to access their data.  On the main page, the department has three options such as students, professors, and courses.  The department can do creation, retrieve, modify, and deletion on any of the options.

Overall, the project is a good experience for me on the programming journey and I am looking forward to the next project.
