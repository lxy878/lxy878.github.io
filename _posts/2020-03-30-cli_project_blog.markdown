Like most projects, the first step is always difficult that is having the idea for a project.  I was stuck on what project I should build.  One day I was noticed from the news that governments in many states enforced restaurants to be closed for COVID-19.  My mind came to an idea which was building a program that could help people cooking their food.  

I attempted to design the gem to have a user-friendly interface.  Users only need to input a number from a recipe list and the program displays the ingredients and the instructions for the recipe.  During the process of building the project, I googled a couple of cooking recipe websites and picked a scrapable website "food52".  Then, I created several classes for a cooking recipe, author, scraping and cli.  Also, I added relationships between recipe class and author class.  Finally, I started developing cli class by adding messages and editing font color.  After code was worked by testing, I cleaned no-use methods and improved/reorganized code as neat as possible.
